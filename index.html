    <h1>Dear Rina,</h1>
    <p>
      I don’t know if words can truly explain how I feel, but I’ll try—because you’re my first love, and I’ll never forget that.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first time I saw you in class X, something changed in me. I didn’t know what it was back then, but now I do—my heart chose you. Every day, I wait just to see your smile, to hear your voice, even if it’s just from a distance. You have a way of making everything feel lighter, brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not even notice me, and that’s okay. I don’t expect anything—I just want you to know how special you are to me. You’re the reason behind my quiet smiles and the little daydreams I get lost in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe someday, we’ll have a chance to talk more, to laugh together. But even if we don’t, you’ll always be my first love, and I’ll always cherish this feeling in my heart.
    </p>

      With all my love,<br>
      Deep
